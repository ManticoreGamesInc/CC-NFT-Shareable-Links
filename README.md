## Finding the Component

This component can be found under the **CoreAcademy** account on Community Content.

## Overview

The NFT Shareable Links component makes copying URLs to NFTs a lot easier by using the Text Entry Box. In the demo that comes with the component, a player can walk up to any of the photo frames and interact with the trigger to open up the UI. The UI contains a text entry box that is auto-filled and selected ready to be copied.

## How to use

The component comes with 2 templates. A template that shows a demo of the component in use. Also, a template is included to create your shareable links without all the other objects included.

Two custom properties need to be set for each shareable link.

- **ContractAddress**
  This is the collection of NFTs you want to pull from.

- **TokenID**
  If set, then only this NFT image will be displayed from the collection set.
